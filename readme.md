# An image slider project

This project contains code to do with html, css, and javascript

The idea is that the user can click on a specific icon and be able to see a different image

Also, the project has an inbuilt timer whereby the images change after every 3 seconds

Thus, the user need not click the icon on the image in order to see the next image
